Welcome to the statue honoring civil rights leader Mahatma Gandhi, “The ‘great-souled one” whose spirit for political greatness came to fruition in a land located on the opposite side of the Earth, in another century, and in another language most of us would not understand but speaks loudly to the richness of Riverside’s soul. 

Born on October 2, 1869, the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India, Mahatma Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.  He lived very modestly and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand spun on a charkha as displayed on the statue before you.

Gandhi first employed civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community’s struggle for civil rights.  After his return to India in 1915, he undertook the organization of farmers and urban laborers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.  Additionally, he led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women’s rights, and building religious and ethnic harmony.  In 1930, Gandhi famously led Indians in the 250 mile Dandi Salt March, challenging the British-imposed salt tax.  

Although Gandhi was committed to nonviolence and truth in all situations, he was imprisoned for many years in both South Africa and India due to his outspoken beliefs.
  
The statue was unveiled on October 9, 2005.
