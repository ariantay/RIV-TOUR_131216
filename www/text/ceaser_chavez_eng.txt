Cesar Chavez rose from humble beginnings to become one of the world’s best-known Mexican Americans and a hero in the Latino civil rights movement. As a farm worker, then a labor leader and ultimately a civil rights activist, Chavez demonstrated the power one individual can have to generate a spark that ignites a movement which can create change in our society. 
As follower and practitioner of nonviolent heroes like Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi, Chavez used non-violence as a form of political protest. Chavez drew attention to the plight of farmworkers not just in California, but around the world. In the process, he inspired countless people, especially Latinos, to fight for their beliefs and not accept the status quo.  Through boycotts, strikes and other political actions, including fasting and other forms of personal sacrifice, Chavez led a movement that turned commitment into change. By the late 1970s, Chavez had turned the United Farm Workers Union, a union he co-founded, into the bargaining unit for 50,000 field workers in California and Florida.  His trademark chant -- “Si, se puede,” or “Yes, we can” moved a generation and beyond.
 His death on April 23, 1993 was mourned by people of all races from across California and throughout the United States. His birthday, March 31, is now known as Cesar Chavez Day and is a state holiday in California, Colorado and Texas.
The statue was unveiled June 8, 2013.
