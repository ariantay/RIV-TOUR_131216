Much like a Hollywood movie, Staff Sergeant Ysmael “Smiley” Villegas, nicknamed “Smiley” because of the broad smile he often had on his face, joined the U.S. Army in July, 1944. About eight months later, Villegas led his men into combat, at the Battle of Luzon, to take a hill for strategic purposes. The enemy was heavily entrenched and fought back vigorously. Even in the face of great danger, Villegas led his men up the hill and, in a move that drew enemy fire to him and away from his men, attacked five enemy foxholes.  “Running like a football player, he charged a network of foxholes, neutralizing five enemy gun squads, saving 400 trapped American soldiers,” an eyewitness reported. But as he made his way to the sixth foxhole, Villegas was mortally wounded. He was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry Truman making Villegas Riverside County’s first recipient of the Medal of Honor. The National Medal of Honor is the highest award the United States of America awards for bravery.  
Villegas grew up in Riverside’s Casa Blanca neighborhood and rose to display true heroism and bravery in World War II. March 20, 1945 – one day before his 21st birthday –Villegas was credited with saving the lives of his entire squadron of U.S. troops.  He was buried with full military honors at Riverside National Cemetery, just a few miles from where he grew up. 
The area around the statue is known as Veterans Plaza, which honors the sacrifices made over the years by members of America’s armed forces. 
The statue was unveiled on May 27, 1995.
