Before you stands a vivacious, charming and well-spoken woman that has more than likely impacted your every day life.  

Born in 1823, Eliza Tibbets lived in New York, Washington D.C. and Ohio before coming to Riverside in the 1870s.  Upon arrival in Riverside, Eliza was interested in plants to grow in their yard located at Central Avenue near Palm so she wrote a letter to a friend from Washington D.C., William Sunders, a gentleman in charge of the U.S. Government Plant Importation Program.  

Immediately, Sunders shipped two samples of seedless naval orange trees to Riverside.  Eliza was diligent in caring for her trees; one account says that she watered the young trees with her dishwater obtained from the Gage Canal.  To her delight of Eliza, the trees quickly took to Riverside’s climate and exceeded all expectations, growing greater with size and with a much improved flavor than when grown in Washington D.C.  In order to credit the originating samples, the delicious orange was appropriately named the Washington Navel.

Eliza is credited with introducing the Washington Navel orange to Riverside and ultimately to the world, giving Riverside an international name and boosting the local economy.  One of the original trees now grows in a tiny, triangular park at the junction of Arlington and Magnolia Avenues.  It still bears a healthy annual crop and is known as the Parent Navel Orange Tree.

The statue was unveiled on August 5, 2011.
