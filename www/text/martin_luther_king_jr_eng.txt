The Martin Luther King Jr. statue was unveiled May 22nd 1999 and was built as a reminder to live the dream of peace, justice and equality for all humankind. Martin Luther King Jr. was a Baptist minister who became a leader in the African-American Civil Rights Movement and ultimately became a Civil Rights icon for the world. In Montgomery, Alabama, he led a boycott against segregated buses.  In Birmingham, Alabama, he organized many nonviolent protests that gained national attention for the brutal actions from the police toward the protestors. Dr. King is best known for his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech that he delivered at the March on Washington. 
This statue shows Martin Luther King Jr. in a minister’s robe flowing with his forward step. The robe has images of the Civil Rights Movement carved into it including Rosa Parks, the Montgomery bus boycott, the March on Washington and the Birmingham Jail where Dr. King wrote his famous letters. The sculptor also included portraits of people such as Gandhi, who inspired King’s philosophy of nonviolent protest, his wife, Coretta King and their children, and others who joined him in the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. King is shown striding forward to capture the spirit of the “I Have a Dream” speech in which he envisions a future where “people are not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of character.”
