The statue here was created to credit the legacy of Korean born “Dosan” Ahn Chang-Ho:  a pioneer, an educator, an orange picker and a patriot. He was a Korean Independence activist and spent seven years in Riverside as a worker and leader of Korean citrus grove workers.  Ahn Chang-Ho was one of the early leaders of the Korean-American immigrant community in the United States.  He is often referred to by his pen name “Dosan” which means Island Mountain.  
Dosan was born in a small town in Korea in 1878 and came to America in 1902. He came to Riverside in 1904 to help the community of Korean farm workers. He lived in a small Korean village on Pachappa Avenue now known as Commerce Street and he picked oranges for Cornelius Earle Rumsey, owner of Alta Cresta Groves.
Dosan was no ordinary ranch hand.  Following Japan’s authorization of Korea in 1910, Dosan formulated the basics for the Provisional Government of Korea right here in Riverside. Dosan left Riverside in 1919 to organize the Korean Provisional Government, as an exile in Shanghai, China. The government upheld the Shanghai Declaration of Independence based on Dosan’s democratic ideals.  He died in 1938 and a national memorial commemorating his work now stands in the center of Gangnam District in Seoul, one of Riverside’s distinguished sister cities. He is one of Korea's most respected patriotic figures and his statue draws people from all over the world.  
The statue was unveiled on August 11, 2001.
